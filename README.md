# KML_FIle-Edit
This project is meant to solve the issue of editing of KML files. KML files are used to store and view geo-coordinates but sometimes the files which are being used would have some issues or a repeated issue. For example in the file present in this repo the coordinates are flipped thus showing wrong places.
